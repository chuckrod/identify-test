This repository should house different bash configurations for linux systems 
to help identify whether that system is a test or production system. 
Alternatively we can also store background images here for any non command 
line system we want to mark this way as well.

Instructions for bash files:
1. Clone this git repository to the linux system you want to change
2. Overwrite the .bashrc file in your home directory with the corresponding
   bash file you want to use.
